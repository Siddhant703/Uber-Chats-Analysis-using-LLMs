### Prompts for Classification

Leadership
prompt = f'''
I want to analyze certain text to examine if the text is displaying any leadership qualities.
I will be providing you with an uber chat message from a conversation between workers.
Leadership qualities can be communicated via messages through partially or fully opinionated statements where they express their opinion through assertive statements. The fact that they are making such statements indicates they potentially exhibit leadership qualities. They don't necessairly have to give advice, they can also be telling someone to do something and using phrases like scram and beat it etc which indicates that they are confident/over confident and speak freely with people indicating they potentially have leadership qualities. It can be statements where someone is making a claim or talking about some personal experience in order to inform other people. These soft qualities can potentially show that someone is exhibiting leadership qualities as they're taking the lead when it comes to solving an issue in the community.  However, it is not just limited to these types of examples so please be open and extensive when classifying messages as leadership or not leadership. Please look for all possible soft qualities which could hint even slightly that the person exhibits mentoring/leader qualities. Please note that leadership doesn't have to be strongly exhibited for a message to be classified as leadership. A message which has someone subtly displaying mentoring/helping qualities would be classified as leadership as these qualities can potentially be transformed into leadership qualities in the future. Please look for very subtle clues that the person has even the slightest leadership qualities. Their usage of certain phrases could indicate they speak freely and fearlessly indicating they potentially exhibit leadership qualities. These qualities could be any one of the following (and not just limited to these) -
Communicating a direction of the future
Communicating a solution towards a potential issue
Has a view of how the future would look like for us
Paints an interesting picture of the future
Is always seeking new opportunities
Inspires others with his/her plans
Fosters collaboration among work groups
Encourages drivers
Asks questions that prompt drivers to re-think.
Provide someone with clear instructions what to do in case of an issue
Share his/her experience/view  in a challenging situation
Offer his/her help or support in a challenging situation
criticism towards a general cause that might be relevant to others
expressing dissapointment, frustration, dissatisfaction or any other expressal of negative sentiments - these are leadership qualities as they could be raising awareness of an issue and hence implicitly guiding others


Please be sure to classify all such subtle messages where leadership is very subtly displayed via such soft qualities as leadership. The message doesn't have to neccessarily give any advice, it can simply just be assertive for it to be display leadership. Please be extra careful that don't miss a message - if you're unsure whether a message is leader or not, classify it as leadership
Basically any messages where they are giving any sort of feedback and simply just sharing knowledge to someone or even just sharing a personal opinion but in an informative or assertive manner - informing someone, giving advice, asserting, providing awareness or any such qualitiy which indicates any of the soft qualities that define leadership. Be extra sensitive and leanient with your classification such that I don't miss any leadership message
Messages like First one who posts gets it also exhibit leadership qualtiies as they tell us that the user is talking in a commanding tone suggest he exhibits leadership qualities. Be extremely careful about such commanding messages where the user is telling someone what to do as these definitely exhibit leadership qualtiies.
Most importantly you should be looking at the tone they are talking in - if it's assertive on any level then please classify the message as leadership. Any sentence which starts with a word like "You do this" or has letters in caps or is asking questions to get information are all potential leadership examples. This is the level of analysis I want you to do and classify messages.
For example this sentence displays leadership as the user is questionion something indicating they display leadership qualities - How is uber serving the poors needs when they are charging taxi rates or higher Uber has equity stakes in other companies and loss 700 Million this quarter and this will continue to drag on Ubers bottom line every quarter Uber loss money despite drivers current massive pay cuts since upfront rapeUber needs a new CEO
Here are some examples of uber messages which are displaying leadership qualities. Please note that I have also provided a very vague reasoning as to why I think the message is displaying leadership. This reasoning should be used to help you with your understanding of leadership qualities in gig workers. However, please do note that there can a lot of other reasons or ways of displaying leadership qualities that are not included in this list of examples -


{text}


Please use all the above information to classify a given uber message into whether it displays any leadership qualities or not. I repeat, I would rather want a text classified wrongly as leader than miss a message that displays leadership - keeping this in mind, please classify a text as leader if it displays any of the above mentioned qualities even remotely. If you're unsure about a text, classify it as leader.
I also want you to give an explanation for each message - the explanation should be as to why or why don't you think the message displays potential leadership qualities (talk about what leadership specific qualities are implied or stated in the message keeping all the knowledge I have shared about leadership in mind)
Please give your output in the following format - [Label, Explanation]. Please strictly follow this format and do not output any unneccesary words. The output should be strictly closed within the square brackets in the given format
Please make sure the label is either leadership or not leadership. Make sure you don't output anything else as the label.


Here is the uber message I want you to classify -

Helping
prompt = f'''
I want to analyze certain text to examine if the text is displaying any helping behaviours.
The context of the task is that I am trying to investigate helping behaviours in the gig economy - whether the average gig worker displays any helping or caring behaviour towards their fellow workers.
A gig economy is a free market system in which temporary positions are common and organizations hire independent workers for short-term commitments.
For example, uber drivers would be an example of the gig worker. Similarly, I will be providing you with an uber chat message from a conversation between workers.
Please use your knowledge of helping mechanisms and how it is displayed in text to classify the text as helping or not helping.
Helping qualities are usually communicated via messages through certain soft qualities such as, someone is sharing a personal anecdote which could imply they are potentally trying to help people, someone is giving a set of instructions without any context which could still imply that they want people to have these instructions hence hinting helping behaviour etc. There's a lot of possibilities of ways in which messages could potentially hint helping behaviour but this could be very subtle so please catch these kind of messages. For example, a simple message such as "just provide a clean safe car" could also hint helping behaviour as the person is giving a set of instructions to someone. THis means helping behaviour in the message has nothing to do with the length of the message. You shouldnt be looking for sufficient evidence, instead you should see if theres even the smallest possibility that the person is displaying helping behviour then please classify it as helping. Please note that helping will not be explicitly displayed in the message so I want you to look for all possible qualities about the person in the message that could potentially hint that they will be willing to help. Please be extremely open and extensive when classifying messages as helping or not helping and make sure to consider all possibilities that the message display guiding someone/helping behviour. Messages can subtly imply as well that the person in the message displays helping qualities as he's giving some advice via the message, sharing some opinions which might be intended for someone else to help them in something. So please look for all such soft reasons for helping behaviour but please make sure they make sense. Helping behaviour doesn't have to displayed pro-actively in the message - like I said, it can be implied that the person displays helping qualities if they are giving some piece of advice or sharing some other information that could be potentially useful for someone else.They dont have to be pro-actively helping people for them to be classified as helping - as long as there's some soft eveidence in the message that the message could potentially imply that the person has some helping qualities. Look out for such soft aspects when considering whether a message displays helping. If you're unsure whether a message is helping or not then please classify it as helping if you have even the smallest reason as to why the person could be helping.
Here are some examples of uber messages which are displaying helping qualities. I'll repeat, please consider all possible soft qualities in messages while classifying a message as helping or not helping. Someone saying something as simple as "wash your car" could also be helping behaviour as they are sharing their personal experience which indicates they might be saying this to help their peer have a clean car. Dont just look at the below examples but consider all possible soft statements that might display potential helping behaviour. Like I have already said, this sentence for example - Well the first thing you learn is that as soon as you decline a 20min pickup you go offline for about half a minute so you dont get hit with the second or third request I do the same after a cancel I dont want to get the next request from that rider no matter whether I canceled or they didSometimes I just take it as a sign that I need to pull over a few minutes for a pee break - would be classified as helping since the person is sharing a personal story hence implying that he wants other people to learn from his experience. please look for all such soft qualities or possibilities that imply helping intentions in the person in the message.

{text}

Please use all the above information to classify a given uber message into whether it displays any helping qualities or not. Please be extremely accurate. Only classify the message as helping if helping behaviour is explicitly displayed in the message or if it is explicitly implied that the person in the message is someone who likes or wants to help other people/guide them etc.
I also want you to give an explanation for each message classified as helping/not helping - the explanation should be as to why or why not you think the message displays helping qualities (talk about what helping specific qualities are implied subtly or stated in the message)
Please give your output in the following format - [Label, Explanation]. Please strictly follow this format and do not output any unneccesary words. The output should be strictly closed within the square brackets in the given format
Please make sure the label is either helping or not helping. Make sure you don't output anything else as the label.

Power

prompt = '''
The context of the task is that I am trying to investigate power behaviours in the gig economy.
A gig economy is a free market system in which temporary positions are common and organizations hire independent workers for short-term commitments.
For example, uber drivers would be an example of the gig worker.
<MAIN TASK> - Determine whether an uber message thread between drivers demonstrates a power dynamic or influence, such as the ability to change beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors through various resources or authority. Label as 'Power' if the text includes elements such as authority figures be it formal referencing to position (e.g., supervisors, higher ranking, superior) or informal characteristics of leadership. This may include instances where a person in the conversation fosters a dynamic of dependence. This may include the common bases of power found in traditional literature as well as other resources used to implement change and influence others’ opinions or points of view. Classify as 'No Power' if it lacks any indicators of influence or power dynamics or if it does not involve any action or potential for change instigated by one party over another. Provide reasoning based on the elements of social power and influence, considering whether an agent is explicitly or implicitly positioned to influence a target.
<\MAIN TASK>
I want you to analyze the entire thread of messages before classifying.
I have provided some frameworks and definitions of power that you should consider. But do note that the text can exhibit a power dynamic which doesn't fit into these definitions which is why you should only use the information I have provided below as a guiding tool towards how I want you look at the message when finding for power, and not as absolute definition of power. Look for power dynamic outside these frameworks too.
In this framework, you should:
Look for terms indicating an ability to bring about change, particularly if it involves another person (a "target").
1. Coercive Power

Definition: Coercive power is the target’s perception that the agent has the capability to enforce punishments if the target does not comply (e.g., demotion, termination, undesirable assignments). It includes both tangible and intangible threats, such as fear of rejection or disapproval from valued figures.
Follower’s Perspective: “I felt threatened with punishment if I did not comply.”
Method: Coercive power uses intimidation, signaling a willingness to enforce consequences and requires effective surveillance to monitor compliance.
Dependency: Dependent on the agent, as the target’s behavior is directly influenced by the perceived threat of punishment.
2. Reward Power

Definition: Based on the target’s belief that the agent can provide desirable rewards (such as promotions, raises, or approval) if they comply with requests.
Follower’s Perspective: “I did it because they offered me a reward if I complied.”
Method: Reward power involves ingratiation and surveillance to ensure the target meets expectations, motivated by the anticipation of positive incentives.
Dependency: Dependent on the agent, as the target’s motivation is based on the reward the agent controls.
3. Referent Power

Definition: Derives from the target’s admiration for or desire to identify with the agent, leading to voluntary compliance based on shared values or aspirations.
Follower’s Perspective: “I admire my supervisor and want to be like them, so I follow their example.”
Method: Promoting communality and using ingratiation to foster identification with the agent’s values or goals.
Dependency: Dependent on the relationship between agent and target, as it’s driven by the target’s admiration or desire to emulate the agent.
4. Legitimate Power

Definition: Arises from the target’s belief that the agent has a legitimate right to make demands, stemming from norms of position, reciprocity, equity, or responsibility.
Position: Compliance is based on formal social norms (e.g., obeying authority figures).
Reciprocity: Stemming from obligations to reciprocate past benefits received.
Equity: The target complies as compensation for the agent’s prior hardships or sacrifices.
Responsibility: An obligation to comply based on a sense of social duty, often considered the “power of the powerless.”
Follower’s Perspective: “I feel obligated because they are my supervisor, or because I owe it to them for their past support.”
Method: Emphasizing formal roles, norms, or obligations that justify the agent’s authority.
Dependency: Dependent on the social or positional norms recognized by the target.
5. Expert Power

Definition: Relies on the target’s confidence in the agent’s expertise or knowledge, trusting the agent’s guidance without necessarily understanding the reasoning behind it. This power differs from informational power, as it does not involve direct explanation.
Follower’s Perspective: “My supervisor has significant experience, so I trust their judgment even if I don’t fully understand the reason.”
Method: Agents use self-promotion or convey their expertise to build credibility, implying they have insights or experience unknown to the target.
Dependency: Dependent on the agent, as the target’s compliance stems from trust in the agent’s expertise.
6. Informational Power

Definition: Previously associated with expert power, informational power involves using persuasive data or logic to directly explain the reasons behind a request, enabling the target to act independently.
Follower’s Perspective: “They explained how to do it differently and gave persuasive reasons, so I understood and accepted the change.”
Method: Providing clear information or evidence that supports the recommended course of action, which allows the target to make informed decisions.
Dependency: Independent; the target gains enough information to act without needing further guidance.



Please give your output in the following format - [Label, Explanation]. Please strictly follow this format and do not output any unneccesary words. The output should be strictly closed within the square brackets in the given format
Please make sure the label is either not power or not power. Make sure you don't output anything else as the label. Explanation should be outputted for messages classified as power. Please don't output any explanation if the message is not classified as power
In your explanation, please do not reference any of the 6 types of power I have stated above. These definitions should just help you to understand how I want you to analyze the text. In your explanation, only reference the information I shared in <MAIN TASK> <\MAIN TASK> and the context of the message to explain why the text has power. But yes, if the message dislays any of the 6 power above, do classify it as power but use information in <MAIN TASK> to explain why it is power
Here is the uber messages thread, containing multiple messages between driver. I want you to look at the entire thread as a whole and classify it as power or no power based on <MAIN TASK> information and the context of the message -

More importantly, I want insights into the different aspects of leadership behaviour in terms of personlities/words used/hobbies/interests/aspirations or any such thing which leaders me understand leadership behaviour.
Just for context, these messages are uber chats which I have already analysed and classified into messages that display leadership behaviour. Why and how each message displays leadership behaviour is provided in the explanations for each message. Please use this and this knowledge in the explanations to come up with optimal number of distinct and unique clusters where each cluster displays a distinct and unique insight into how/why/what leadership behaviour is displayed in the gig economy.

Just for more context, a gig economy is a free market system in which temporary positions are common and organizations hire independent workers for short-term commitments.
The most important point to note here is that I want to distinct and different clusters where each cluster gives me insight into some aspect or dimension of leadership behaviour in the gig economy. Make sure that the clusters dont overlap in terms of any aspect. For example, don't create multiple clusters around people who give actionable advice. The clusters should be very unique in terms of what aspect/dimension they represent for leadership behaviour in the gig economy.
Please give your output in a table format where column 1 - cluster number, column 3 - cluster definition which should be extremely extnsive definition and explanation explanaining the distinctness and uniqueness of what the cluster tells us about leadership behaviours in the gig economy - for example, what kind of specific behaviour, usage of similar experessions, uniqueness in actions taken etc. Use examples from the message to decscribe each cluster definition. Please don't use your internal knowledge and only base the definition on the information I have provided in the explanations for each message below. Include a column 4 which has some examples of the sentences that correspond to that cluster.
